# SASS_BASICS
CSS WITH SUPERPOWER
Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

If you’re looking for an introduction to Sass, check out the tutorial.

If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than the built-in module reference.

If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the JS API documentation.

Or the Dart API documentation if you’re calling it from Dart.

Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference!
